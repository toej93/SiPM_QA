# GNUPLOT_PATH: path to gnuplot executable file
GNUPLOT_PATH  "/usr/bin/"

# OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT: output file can be either ASCII (column of decimal numbers) or binary 
# (2 bytes per sample, except for Mod 721 and Mod 731 that is 1 byte per sample)
# options: BINARY, ASCII
OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT  ASCII

# OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER: if enabled, the header is included in the output file data
# options: YES, NO
OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER  NO

# RECORD_LENGTH = number of samples in the acquisition window
# For the models 742 the options available are only 1024, 520, 256 and 136
RECORD_LENGTH  1024

# TEST_PATTERN: if enabled, data from ADC are replaced by test pattern (triangular wave)
# options: YES, NO
TEST_PATTERN   NO

# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY

# FAST_TRIGGER: fast trigger input settings. ONLY FOR 742 MODELS. When enabled, the fast trigger is used
# for the data acquisition 
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY
FAST_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY	
#FAST_TRIGGER   DISABLED	

# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. Higher values may lead
# to higher readout bandwidth, requiring more memory allocation for the block transfer.
# options: 1 to 1023
MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT   1

# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100
# On models 742 there is a delay of about 35nsec on signal Fast Trigger TR; the post trigger is added to
# this delay  
POST_TRIGGER  20

# TRIGGER_EDGE: decides whether the trigger occurs on the rising or falling edge of the signal
# options: RISING, FALLING
TRIGGER_EDGE  FALLING

# USE_INTERRUPT: number of events that must be ready for the readout when the IRQ is asserted.
# Zero means that the interrupts are not used (readout runs continuously)
# values: 0 to 1023
USE_INTERRUPT 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM

# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access
# to the registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed AFTER the other settings,
# thus it might happen that the direct write overwrites a specific setting.
# To avoid this use the right "MASK".
# Syntax: WRITE_REGISTER ADDRESS DATA MASK, where ADDRESS is the address offset of the register (16 bit hex), DATA
# is the value being written (32 bit hex) and MASK is the bitmask to be used for DATA masking.
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 1, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0100 0100
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 0, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0000 0100
# Example: Set register 1080 to the value of 0x45:
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 45 FFFFFFFF

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel (or one group in the case of the Mod 740 and Mod 742)
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_INPUT          NO

# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# For model 740 and 742* the DC offset adjust is the same for all channel in the group
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)*
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)*
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)*
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)
#*NOTE: Ranges are different for 742 Model.....see GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET description
DC_OFFSET              0

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)
TRIGGER_THRESHOLD      100

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT, and TRGOUT_ONLY
# NOTE: since in x730 boards even and odd channels are paired, their 'CHANNEL_TRIGGER' value
# will be equal to the one specified on the even channel, unless one of the two channels of
# the pair is set to 'DISABLED'. If so, the other one behaves as usual.
