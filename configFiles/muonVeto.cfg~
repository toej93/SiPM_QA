[COMMON]

# OPEN: open the digitizer
# options: USB 0 0      Desktop/NIM digitizer through USB              
#          USB 0 BA     VME digitizer through USB-V1718 (BA = BaseAddress of the VME board, 32 bit hex)
#          PCI 0 0 0    Desktop/NIM/VME through CONET (optical link) 
#          PCI 0 0 BA   VME digitizer through V2718 (BA = BaseAddress of the VME board, 32 bit hex)

# GNUPLOT_PATH: path to gnuplot executable file
GNUPLOT_PATH  "/usr/bin/"

# OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT: output file can be either ASCII (column of decimal numbers) or binary 
# (2 bytes per sample, except for Mod 721 and Mod 731 that is 1 byte per sample)
# options: BINARY, ASCII
OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT  BINARY

# OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER: if enabled, the header is included in the output file data
# options: YES, NO
OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER  YES


# OUTPUT_FILE_COMBINE: if enabled, all waves written to single file
# options: YES, NO
OUTPUT_FILE_COMBINE  YES

# OUTPUT_NO_PARSE: if enabled, skip all event read steps
# options: YES, NO
OUTPUT_NO_PARSE  YES

# RUN_TIME
RUN_TIME  300


# RECORD_LENGTH = number of samples in the acquisition window
RECORD_LENGTH  300

# TEST_PATTERN: if enabled, data from ADC are replaced by test pattern (triangular wave)
# options: YES, NO
TEST_PATTERN   NO

# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER  ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT 

# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. Higher values may lead
# to higher readout bandwidth, requiring more memory allocation for the block transfer.
# options: 1 to 1023
MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT   1023

# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100
POST_TRIGGER  60

# TRIGGER_EDGE: decides whether the trigger occurs on the rising or falling edge of the signal
# options: RISING, FALLING
TRIGGER_EDGE  RISING

# USE_INTERRUPT: number of events that must be ready for the readout when the IRQ is asserted.
# Zero means that the interrupts are not used (readout runs continuously)
# values: 0 to 1023
USE_INTERRUPT 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM


# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access
# to the registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed AFTER the other settings,
# thus it might happen that the direct write overwrites a specific setting.

# Trigger modes
#WRITE_REGISTER 810C C00000FF C70000FF # local trigger for all channels
#WRITE_REGISTER 810C C10000FF C70000FF # local trigger for all channels, coincidence level > 1


# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel (or one group in the case of the Mod 740 and Mod 742)
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_INPUT          NO

# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# For model 740 and 742* the DC offset adjust is the same for all channel in the group
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)*
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)*
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)*
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)
#*NOTE: Ranges are different for 742 Model.....see GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET description
# DC_OFFSET              0

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)
# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD      100

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
# CHANNEL_TRIGGER        DISABLED
